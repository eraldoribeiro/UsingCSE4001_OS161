# System documentation 

There are UNIX-style manual (man) pages for all of the OS/161 system calls, the OS/161 device drivers, the OS/161 user-level utility programs, the OS/161 test programs, and standard C library, which contains basic functions that can be used by user-level applications. All of these manual pages are in HTML format and are included as part of the OS/161 distribution.

Once OS/161 has been installed, you can view the OS/161 man pages by starting a WWW browser and using it to open the file `~/os161/src/man/index.html`. This is a master index file that contains links to groups of individual man pages.

There is also [documentation for the sys/161 simulator](http://www.os161.org/documentation/sys161-1.99.07/)
